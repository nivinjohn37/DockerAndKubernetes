# Docker Image Layer

---

Docker images are built from a set of layers. Each layer represents an instruction in the imageâ€™s Dockerfile. Each layer except the very last one is read-only.

### Key Concepts

- **Layers**: Docker images consist of multiple layers stacked on top of each other. Each layer corresponds to a specific instruction in the Dockerfile, such as `RUN`, `COPY`, or `ADD`.
    - **Example**: Consider the following Dockerfile:
    This Dockerfile will create an image with the following layers:
        
        ```
        FROM ubuntu:20.04
        RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3
        COPY . /app
        
        ```
        
        1. The `ubuntu:20.04` base image layer.
        2. A layer for the `RUN` instruction to update and install Python3.
        3. A layer for the `COPY` instruction to copy the application files into the `/app` directory.
- **Read-Only Layers**: All layers except the topmost layer are read-only. This ensures that the base layers remain unchanged and consistent across different containers.
- **Container Layer**: When you create a new Docker container, a new writable layer is added on top of the underlying image layers. This writable layer is known as the "container layer".
    - **Example**: If you run a container from the above image and modify a file or add new files within the container, these changes are stored in the writable container layer.

### Advantages of Layer System

- **Reusability and Sharing**: Docker promotes reusability and sharing of layers. If multiple images share the same base layers, Docker only stores one copy of those layers, saving disk space.
    - **Example**: If you have multiple Docker images based on the `ubuntu:20.04` image, Docker will store only one copy of the `ubuntu:20.04` layer on the system.
- **Efficient Transfers**: When pulling or pushing images, Docker only transfers layers that are not already present on the source or destination system. This reduces network usage and speeds up the transfer process.
    - **Example**: If you modify the above Dockerfile to install an additional package, only the new layer for the package installation will be transferred when you push the updated image to a Docker registry, assuming the base layers are already present.

### How Layers Work

1. **Base Image**: The starting point for your Docker image, often an official image from Docker Hub, like `ubuntu:20.04`.
2. **Intermediate Layers**: Each subsequent instruction in the Dockerfile creates a new layer. These layers build upon each other, with each new layer representing changes or additions.
3. **Final Image**: The culmination of all layers, forming the Docker image that can be used to create containers.
4. **Container Layer**: A writable layer added when a container is run from the image, capturing any changes made during the container's runtime.
    - **Example**: Running `docker run -it my-image /bin/bash` from the above image and creating a new file inside the container will result in the new file being saved in the writable container layer.

### Visual Representation

```
+------------------+
| Container Layer  |  (Writable)
+------------------+
| Layer 3: COPY    |  (Read-only)
+------------------+
| Layer 2: RUN     |  (Read-only)
+------------------+
| Layer 1: FROM    |  (Read-only)
+------------------+

```

In this representation, changes made to the container, such as adding or modifying files, occur in the writable container layer on top.

By understanding and utilizing Docker image layers effectively, you can create efficient, reusable, and easily shared Docker images.
