# Docker Help, Tagging and Naming

---

### Docker Help Command

The Docker help command provides information about Docker commands and their usage.

- **Usage**: To get help on any Docker command, you can use the `docker help` command followed by the specific command you need help with.
    - **Example**:
    This command will display detailed information about the `docker run` command, including its options and usage.
        
        ```
        docker help run
        
        ```
        

### Deleting the Container While Stopping a Container

To delete a container automatically when it stops, use the `--rm` flag with the `docker run` command.

- **Usage**:
This command will run the container and automatically remove it once it stops.
    
    ```
    docker run --rm my-image
    
    ```
    

### Inspecting Images

The `docker inspect` command is used to obtain detailed information about Docker images and containers.

- **Usage**: To inspect an image, use the `docker inspect` command followed by the image ID or name.
    - **Example**:
    This command will display detailed information about the `my-image` image, including its layers, configuration, and metadata.
        
        ```
        docker inspect my-image
        
        ```
        

### Logs and Filters

The `docker logs` command retrieves the logs from a running container. You can use various filters to narrow down the logs.

- **Usage**: To view the logs of a container, use the `docker logs` command followed by the container ID or name.
    - **Example**:
        
        ```
        docker logs my-container
        
        ```
        
- **Filters**: You can use filters such as `-tail`, `-since`, and `-until` to refine the logs.
    - **Example**:
    This command will display the last 50 lines of logs from `my-container`.
        
        ```
        docker logs --tail 50 my-container
        
        ```
        

### Popular Commands

Here are some popular Docker commands that are commonly used:

- **docker run**: Run a new container from an image.
    - **Example**:
    This command runs `my-image` in detached mode and maps port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container.
        
        ```
        docker run -d -p 80:80 my-image
        
        ```
        
- **docker ps**: List running containers.
    - **Example**:
    This command lists all currently running containers.
        
        ```
        docker ps
        
        ```
        
- **docker build**: Build an image from a Dockerfile.
    - **Example**:
    This command builds an image named `my-image` from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
        
        ```
        docker build -t my-image .
        
        ```
        
- **docker pull**: Pull an image from a Docker registry.
    - **Example**:
    This command pulls the `ubuntu:20.04` image from Docker Hub.
        
        ```
        docker pull ubuntu:20.04
        
        ```
        
- **docker push**: Push an image to a Docker registry.
    - **Example**:
    This command pushes the `my-image` image to the `my-repo` repository.
        
        ```
        docker push my-repo/my-image
        
        ```
        

### Docker Tagging and Naming of Containers and Images

Docker tags and names are used to identify and manage images and containers.

- **Tagging Images**: Use the `docker tag` command to tag an image with a specific name and version.
    - **Example**:
    This command tags the `my-image` with the name `my-repo/my-image` and version `1.0`.
        
        ```
        docker tag my-image my-repo/my-image:1.0
        
        ```
        
- **Naming Containers**: When running a container, you can assign it a name using the `-name` flag.
    - **Example**:
    This command runs a container from the `my-image` image and names it `my-container`.
        
        ```
        docker run --name my-container my-image
        
        ```
        

By mastering these commands and concepts, you can effectively manage and inspect Docker images and containers, enhancing your Docker workflow.
