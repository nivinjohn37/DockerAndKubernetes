# Share Docker Images

---

### Share Dockerfile and Source Code

Sharing a Dockerfile and the source code allows others to build the Docker image on their own systems. This approach requires the recipient to have Docker installed and to run the build command.

- **Build with the required files in place**:
    - **Step-by-Step**:
        1. **Create a Dockerfile**: Write a Dockerfile that specifies the instructions to build the Docker image.
        - **Example**:
            
            ```
            FROM ubuntu:20.04
            RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3
            COPY . /app
            CMD ["python3", "/app/app.py"]
            
            ```
            
        1. **Share the Dockerfile and Source Code**: Package the Dockerfile and the source code into a version control system (like Git) or a compressed file (like ZIP).
        - **Example**:
            
            ```
            project/
            ├── Dockerfile
            ├── app/
            │   └── app.py
            └── requirements.txt
            
            ```
            
        1. **Build the Image**: The recipient can build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
        - **Command**:
            
            ```
            docker build -t my-image .
            
            ```
            

### Share a Complete Built Image

Sharing a complete built image allows others to run a container from the image without needing to build it themselves. This is useful when the build process is complex or time-consuming.

- **Download an image, run a container based on it**:
    - **Step-by-Step**:
        1. **Build the Image**: Build the Docker image on your system.
        - **Command**:
            
            ```
            docker build -t my-image .
            
            ```
            
        1. **Push the Image to a Registry**: Push the built image to a Docker registry, such as Docker Hub or a private registry.
        - **Command**:
            
            ```
            docker tag my-image my-repo/my-image:1.0
            docker push my-repo/my-image:1.0
            
            ```
            
        1. **Share the Image**: Provide the image name and tag to the recipient.
        - **Example**:
            
            ```
            docker pull my-repo/my-image:1.0
            docker run my-repo/my-image:1.0
            
            ```
            
    - **No build step required**: The recipient does not need to perform any build steps, as everything is included in the image already.

### Docker Images with Docker Hub or Private Registry

Docker images can be shared via Docker Hub or a private registry. Docker Hub is the official public registry, but private registries can be set up for restricted access.

- **Official Docker Images Registry**:
    - Docker Hub is the default and official registry for Docker images, where you can find both public and official images.
- **Public, Private, and Official Images**:
    - **Public Images**: These images are available to everyone. You can search and pull public images from Docker Hub.
    - **Private Images**: These images are restricted to specific users or teams. You need to set up a private registry or use Docker Hub’s private repository feature.
    - **Official Images**: These are verified and maintained by Docker, ensuring they meet certain standards and are generally considered secure and reliable.
    - **Examples**:
        - **Public Image**:
            
            ```
            docker pull ubuntu:20.04
            
            ```
            
        - **Private Image** (hosted on Docker Hub):
            
            ```
            docker pull my-repo/my-private-image:1.0
            
            ```
            
        - **Official Image**:
            
            ```
            docker pull nginx:latest
            
            ```
            

By mastering these methods, you can efficiently share Docker images and streamline the development and deployment process across different environments and teams.
